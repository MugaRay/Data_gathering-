the 1990s (during CODESA) stems from it.
5. As for Mr Jacob Zuma, the man has been quoted on several occasions saying
he is still a member of the African National Congress and he will not for it but
for the MK party instead. This clearly indicates that there is no difference
between the MK party and the ANC. Any talks with the MK party are as the

Revolutionary Greetings
We as the Pan Africanist Congress of Azania have noted with great concern and shock
the visit of Mr Mzwanele Nyontso who claims to be the president visit to Inkandla
(Mr Jacob Zuma's compound) where we are told that discussions on cooperation were
discussed
1. We hereby distance the PAC of Azania from this visit the touted unity talks, we
remain diametrically opposed to any party that subscribes and promotes the
sell-out document called ""Freedom Charter"" as is the case with the MK party
and its leaders We remain convinced that our betrayal both in 1955 and 1990's
stems from the Freedom Charter.
2. At the core of our struggle as the PAC remains the land which was, and
continues to be prostituted by the Freedom Charter which has been entrenched
in the country's constitution with its most reactionary and deceiving line which
says ""South Africa belongs to all who live in it, both black and white"" thus
declaring our country a no-man's land

@alfred_cabonena
Article by Gaynor Ungerer
Before I start my rant of disbelief and shock, let me first familiarize you
with the current SASSA grants available to citizens, foreigners, and
refugees.
There are nine grants managed by SASSA, namely the Care Dependency
Grant, the Child Support Grant, the Disability Grant, the Foster Child
Grant, the Grant In-Aid, the Older Person Grant, the Social Relief Grant,
the War Veterans Grant, and the Covid-19 Social Relief of Distress.
For this exercise, we will be focusing on how the Child Support Grant
(R480 + R240 CSG) in conjunction with the Foster Child Grant (R1 050)
enables six non-citizen adults and four children to draw a combined R38
520.00 each month.
I was approached earlier this week by one of the locals in my area,
requesting me to help him with paperwork for his wife to enable her to
claim from SASSA. He has two wives, one that lives with him here in the
winelands and another who lives in town. He has one child per wife and
is not legally married to either. He also has a brother that lives here in the
winelands, and his wife is back in Zimbabwe.
She visited South Africa a year ago, heavily pregnant, and left to go back
to Zimbabwe once her daughter was born. Little did I know that she
came here specifically to give birth for the sole purpose of accessing the
grants.
These babies are known as ""anchor babies"".
They also have a 'brother' in the winelands who also has a wife and a
child. Voila! Six Adults, four children. He presented me with a download
link to a form off SASSA's website. I printed it out and helped him fill it in.
I was astonished to read on SASSA's website that no more than six
people can apply for Foster Child Grant per child. Six people, I asked?
How can six people apply for a care grant for one child. But wait, let me
explain ... you qualify for the grant if you look after a child for more than
three days in a month-cycle or say you look after a specific child for",Twitter/X

realize that for decades white leadership had a program to create
#KaffirKiller diseases and Saimr even went as far as vaccinating black

Then with the white farm owners dead
the land was given to the citizens. Only
one problem. None of them knew how
to farm so they suffered huge famine
and once again the Government blamed
