[BREAKING NEWS]
The National Assembly Passes The BELA Bill
The South African Parliament has passed in the National Assembly this afternoon with 223
votes supporting and 83 against the BELA Bill.
Executive Summary
The Bill proposes to amend the South African Schools Act, 1996 (Act No. 84 of 1996), and the
Employment of Educators Act, 1998 (Act No. 76 of 1898) (the SASA and the EEA, respectively),
so as to align them with developments in the education landscape and to ensure that systems
of learning are put in place in a manner which gives effect to the right to basic education
enshrined in section 29(1) of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996.
Key Amendments:
1. Making Grade R the new compulsory school-starting age
2. Religion: The bill proposes that a code of conduct developed by a school must be sensitive
to cultural beliefs and religious observances.
3. Corporal punishment: The bill confirms that corporal punishment is no longer allowed at
schools. It proposes that a person who carries out corporal punishment pay a fine or be
sent to prison.
4. Sale of alcohol on school premises: This clause provides for the possession, consumption,
or sale of liquor during any private or religious function held on school premises.
5. Language policy: This clause seeks to amend Section 6 of the SASA Act to provide for the
governing body to submit the language policy of a public school and any amendment
thereof to the head of department for approval
6. Criminalising parents who don't ensure their children are in school
7. Allows learners to perform abortion without consent from ""guardians""
8. Introduces sex Education in all its forms.
The BILL will now be tabled before the NCOP before it can be signed into Law by The President.

NEWS: A faction of the PAC has distanced itself from
party President Mzwanele Nyhontsho and his mooted
collaboration pact with the MK Party backed by former
President Jacob Zuma. The faction led by Mbuso
Dlamini, the party's deputy Secretary-General, says
they remain opposed to any party that subscribes to
the Freedom Charter as the ""betrayal"" in 1955 and in
the 1990s (during CODESA) stems from it.
5. As for Mr Jacob Zuma, the man has been quoted on several occasions saying
he is still a member of the African National Congress and he will not for it but
for the MK party instead. This clearly indicates that there is no difference
between the MK party and the ANC. Any talks with the MK party are as the

Deputy-Secretary General: PAC
: THE PAC REJECTS NYONTSHO'S VISIT TO INKANDLA
Revolutionary Greetings
We as the Pan Africanist Congress of Azania have noted with great concern and shock
the visit of Mr Mzwanele Nyontso who claims to be the president visit to Inkandla
(Mr Jacob Zuma's compound) where we are told that discussions on cooperation were
discussed
1. We hereby distance the PAC of Azania from this visit the touted unity talks, we
remain diametrically opposed to any party that subscribes and promotes the
sell-out document called ""Freedom Charter"" as is the case with the MK party
and its leaders We remain convinced that our betrayal both in 1955 and 1990's
stems from the Freedom Charter.
2. At the core of our struggle as the PAC remains the land which was, and
continues to be prostituted by the Freedom Charter which has been entrenched
in the country's constitution with its most reactionary and deceiving line which
says ""South Africa belongs to all who live in it, both black and white"" thus
declaring our country a no-man's land

The complaint pertains to a tweet containing a link to an article that has been debunked by AfricaCheck as disinformation regarding SASSA grants. ,"Sir Cabonena Alfred
@alfred_cabonena
Article by Gaynor Ungerer
Before I start my rant of disbelief and shock, let me first familiarize you
with the current SASSA grants available to citizens, foreigners, and
refugees.
There are nine grants managed by SASSA, namely the Care Dependency
Grant, the Child Support Grant, the Disability Grant, the Foster Child
Grant, the Grant In-Aid, the Older Person Grant, the Social Relief Grant,
the War Veterans Grant, and the Covid-19 Social Relief of Distress.
For this exercise, we will be focusing on how the Child Support Grant
(R480 + R240 CSG) in conjunction with the Foster Child Grant (R1 050)
enables six non-citizen adults and four children to draw a combined R38
520.00 each month.
I was approached earlier this week by one of the locals in my area,
requesting me to help him with paperwork for his wife to enable her to
claim from SASSA. He has two wives, one that lives with him here in the
winelands and another who lives in town. He has one child per wife and
is not legally married to either. He also has a brother that lives here in the
winelands, and his wife is back in Zimbabwe.
She visited South Africa a year ago, heavily pregnant, and left to go back
to Zimbabwe once her daughter was born. Little did I know that she
came here specifically to give birth for the sole purpose of accessing the
grants.
These babies are known as ""anchor babies"".
They also have a 'brother' in the winelands who also has a wife and a
child. Voila! Six Adults, four children. He presented me with a download
link to a form off SASSA's website. I printed it out and helped him fill it in.
I was astonished to read on SASSA's website that no more than six
people can apply for Foster Child Grant per child. Six people, I asked?
How can six people apply for a care grant for one child. But wait, let me
explain ... you qualify for the grant if you look after a child for more than
three days in a month-cycle or say you look after a specific child for",Twitter/X

In South Africa, many born frees are overly trusting of white politicians

realize that for decades white leadership had a program to create
#KaffirKiller diseases and Saimr even went as far as vaccinating black
people with HIV through doctors and clinics, hence the high HIV rate in
SA.
Many of those doctors are still practicing today and their prominence will

Now that we have established some level of trust, I am sending you more information extracted from the investigation,
but not in the report I sent you. This will help you have impactful article this coming Sunday.
Please keep my possible involvement out, because for a month no one leaked anything.
You'll receive the balance of your payment after the publishing of the story.

This complaint brings to light a significant concern regarding the omission of information about the nationalities of the individuals responsible for the tragic murder of John Makola. It underscores that mainstream media outlets have refrained from disclosing these key details. The complainant asserts that this omission may unintentionally contribute to heightened tensions within the community of Diepsloot.,"IG:Joy-Zelds

just Farmers leading to a Civil War.
Then with the white farm owners dead
the land was given to the citizens. Only
one problem. None of them knew how
to farm so they suffered huge famine
and once again the Government blamed

SAFETY NOTICE 20/03 PROTEST
- BOLO FOR TYRES
Next week monday the 20th the
EFF intend to protest a number of
their grievances and bring areas to
a standstill
Two incidents today I where
members of the CPF, Private
Security sector, and SAPS have
located abandoned tyres at key
points such as intersections (trees
nearby) and similar type areas.
Such tyres were removed
It is thought that this may be used
in the Monday protests (to block
the roads and set the tyres alight).
Tyres are being dumped from now
as it may be difficult to transport
tyres to areas by want-to-be-
strikers whose aim is to block
roads with burning tyres and
create blockages as part of their
protest.

@Gentlements
Paul O'Sullivan is the most racist
white man and they (SANEF)
are scared of him. He harrassed
a black woman journalist
and no one said anything.

ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING. Who allowed
this dreadful women into a school to talk
to children. Parents need to sue.
Can't have these black racists spreading
their vile filth. Black and white racists are
cut from same cloth, SA needs neither,
they will divide rather than heal.

1) Last week my Twitter account
was hacked and tweeted porn. I
deleted the tweets and changed
my password. But Afriforum
Youth now says it will lodge a
criminal complaint against me.
Not surprising given the criticism
I
levelled against their hate speech
case against Mr Malema.

2) Obviously, nothing will come of this
complaint, but I will continue to criticise
Afriforum when I believe it is appropriate
to do so. I will, of course, refrain from
making spurious allegations against them.

Terry Pheto said it herself that she
doesn't feel safe around South African
men.
So what makes you think she would go
into the risky business of stealing of Lotto
Funds with SA men?
Go ask her about identity of those men.
